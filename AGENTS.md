# Style

- Two spaces for indentation, no tabs
- Use bash 5 conditionals: use `[[ ]]` for string/file tests and `(( ))` for numeric tests
- In `[[ ]]`, don't quote variables, but do quote string literals when comparing values (e.g., `[[ $branch == "dev" ]]`)
- Prefer `(( ))` over numeric operators inside `[[ ]]` (e.g., `(( count < 50 ))`, not `[[ $count -lt 50 ]]`)
- For strings/paths with spaces, quote them instead of escaping spaces with `\ ` (e.g., `"$APP_DIR/Disk Usage.desktop"`, not `$APP_DIR/Disk\ Usage.desktop`)
- Shebangs must use `#!/bin/bash` consistently (never `#!/usr/bin/env bash`)
